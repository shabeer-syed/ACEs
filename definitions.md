# Conceptual model of ACEs and family violence as function of cumulative adversity
---------------------------------

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabeer-syed/ACEs/main/formulation%20lower%20res%201.png)

The above figure is an illustrative example of an integration of the socio-ecological system theory ([1](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-98662-005),[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7386966/)), and the biopsychosocial cumulative stress model ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22201156/),[4](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-26231-001)) that informed the selection of relevant ACEs in this study.

It does not represent an exhaustive list of factors or mechanisms of ACEs or outcomes.

In summary, the figure shows family violence (CM/mIPV) as outcomes from a cumulation of underlying adversity in the context of co-occurring intergenerational risk factors, ([5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33689982/)) and limited resources across two levels (society/family).

People cope with stress and perception of threat using different preventative strategies (e.g. avoidance, escape, fight) in an attempt to minimise negative consequences (e.g. see [theories on emotional processing](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1986-15090-001), [selective attention and overestimation of threat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10402694/)).

Whilst strategies are perceived as logical in the moment, over time, they can leave families in a cycle that perpetuates stress (e.g. avoidance prevents learning from experience). As underlying stress increases and without mediation, caregivers have fewer resources to cope and regulate responses (e.g. reduced response inhibition/executive functioning) ([6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12212647/)) increasing the risk of more immediate coping responses to escape or re-gaining control (e.g. shouting, violence, neglect etc).

Coping responses may vary as a function of the level of need to escape distress and harm, ranging from immediate escape (e.g. violence, substance misuse, abandonment/neglect), to stronger forms of avoidance (e.g. avoiding going out which reduce social support systems in the longer-term) ([7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JOBA.0000007455.08539.94)) 

The model, therefore, considers families as resilient and constantly striving to cope using different strategies and resources at hand (e.g. protective factors). We consider ACEs recorded at the family level (middle segment) as amenable to service level intervention and relevant to electronic health records (see above for all criteria).

## Definitions of the final ACE domains and the reference standard used for validation
---------------------------------

**Outcome/reference standard: Definitive child maltreatment (CM) and maternal intimate partner violence (mIPV) 2-years pre-birth up to 5-years post birth**

A composite variable of the definite CM and mIPV domains, containing indicators such as neglect (pre-post birth), child protection recordings or out-of-home placements by social care services (see eTables 4, 8-9).51 CM and mIPV often co-occur as forms of family violence. We selected this reference standard to encapsulate consistent core ACEs (CM/mIPV), clinically meaningful outcomes, and to represent a cumulation of underlying adversity.4 9 We also aimed to use a reference standard that separates adverse experiences from the adverse stress response of the child.54  Indicators included in the reference standard were excluded from the development/validation. eTable 4 lists all included and excluded indicators by domains. 

**Definitive or probable CM (reference standard; birth up to 5-years post-birth)**

Any recorded act of commission or omission by a parent or caregiver resulting in harm, the potential for harm or threat of child harm, including neglect, psychological, physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Harm does not need to be intended.45 46 In the UK, statutory guidelines of CM include child exposure to IPV, and maternal evidence for omission or commission during pregnancy such as NAS and FAS.45 46 

**Definitive or probable mIPV (reference standard; 2-years pre-birth up to 5-years post-birth)**

Any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are, or have been, intimate partners or family members.51 We restricted mIPV indicators to mothers aged ≥16 and their corresponding children to prevent misclassification of CM in younger mothers.

**1. Suspected CM**

This domain excludes any indicator of CM/mIPV described above. Suspected CM included any maltreatment-related indicator with codes or measures describing presentations likely to refer to CM but without mentioning the underlying cause (e.g. harm caused by non-specified person), safeguarding procedures or child social service interventions.48 For instance, the “suspected CM, NOS” indicator contains codes mentioning “Victim of sexual abuse”, “Multi-professional risk assessment done”, “Assault in the home”.

**2. Suspected maternal intimate partner violence (mIPV; excluding reference standard)**

As in suspected CM, excludes any “definitive” indicator of mIPV but may include indicators with coding terms mentioning historic mIPV or maltreatment by an unspecified person. For instance, the “suspected mIPV, NOS” indicator contains codes mentioning “[X]Maltreatment, by acquaintance or friend”,” Risk of non-accidental injury”, “Assault in the home”. 

**3. High-risk presentations of CM (HRP-CM)**

Indicators consistent with NICE Clinical guidelines [CG89] recommended high-risk child presentations that should raise clinical suspicions for CM. To be interpreted as warning signs of maltreatment in the face of uncertainty and the absence of evidence for CM. All indicators are recorded in the child, except for non-attendance of child appointments which uses both maternal and child records.

**4. Maternal substance misuse (MSM)**

Any consumption of alcohol/drugs meeting threshold for harmful or addictive levels such as codes mentioning "dependence", "specialist/enhanced treatment", class A through C drugs (e.g. A: heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD), self-report measures (≥35 alcohol units per week higher risk drinking)55 and validated measures with higher cut-off scores (≥20 AUDIT score, SADQ ≥31 scores etc). Indicators for alcohol consumption are also provided by CALIBER.

**5. Adverse family environments (AFE)**

Any experiences in the child's family
environment (not included above) meeting the above inclusion criteria. Incorporates Royal College of General Practitioners recommended indicators for children/families who are a cause for concern. 39 52 

**6. Maternal mental health problems (mMHPs)**

Contains indicators of mutually exclusive symptom clusters aligning with disorder classifications laid out by DSM-5/ICD-10 excluding substance misuse. Some codes for self-harm (e.g. overdose) may be represented across both mMHPs and MSM domains. 
mMHPs indicators are ascertained using read codes, prescriptions, ICD-10 codes or by meeting the higher cut-off score on a validated self-report instrument or validated algorithms with prescriptions.56
