# Panel ratings: Indicators of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) for routine primary and secondary electronic health records
### [Go back](https://shabeer-syed.github.io/ACEs/)

## Introduction
An estimated 1 in 4 families present to health care with recorded adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and substantially higher risks of poorer health outcomes, repeated hospital admissions and care costs.

Everyone recognises the very significant challenges of identifying and monitoring of ACEs across individual services and nationally. We know GPs, clinical teams as well as researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

We have therefore invited you to complete a survey to help us decide on relevant ACE indicators for identifying at-risk families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 10-years post-birth.

### Why are adverse childhood experiences important to measure using routine data?
Numerous clinical and UK public health policies (1,2,3,4,5) prioritise early identification of ACEs to effectively offer high-risk families support in national and local improvement program (e.g. family nurse partnership). Indicators in electronic health records (EHRs) allow for automated early clinical warning systems and longitudinal population-based classification of high-risk populations for targeted interventions at a relatively low cost. The ability to link mother's and children's records provides an opportunity to measure ACEs intergenerationally and during vital periods of prevention with regular follow-ups across care systems.

## The survey
Having read the guidance notes, this survey will take 20-60 mins to complete. The survey will ask you to rate different routinely recorded indicators of potential ACEs to help us in the selection process of deriving a final set of relevant indicators. Your "ratings" will only be available to the main researcher and their supervisors (see below). If you agree to participate, we may invite you via email to a second round of ratings. Where relevant, the second round will help resolve disagreements from the first round by providing you additional information (i.e. overall ratings from 1st round) to guide your decisions. Your input will be acknowledged in any publication.

### Instructions
An indicator combines codes or measures of similar health care presentations.

Below is a list of manually selected indicators containing potential recordings of ACEs from GP practices and hospital admissions of child (aged 0-10 years) or maternal (12-50 years) presentations. This set of indicators are classed as “tentative” as they showed inconsistent risk associations with a pre-defined ACE reference marker (e.g. child maltreatment, intimate partner violence) across different machine and manual statistical prediction models (n=472,000 patients).

We would like you to rate each indicator on a scale, 0-10, for its relevance and appropriateness to indicate an ACE.
Please use the below criteria and rating guidance (see next page) along with your professional judgement to rate indicator’s on their individual basis regardless of context (e.g. dynamic and protective factors), considering the average families you’ve seen clinically ignoring any cost/time implications.

### Overall definition
We define ACEs as stress indicators of frightening or traumatic experiences that happen to a child due to compromised safety within the family (intentionally or unintentionally), with potential for immediate or longer-term biopsychosocial child harm (“toxic stress”) regardless of actual child outcomes.

## Selection Criteria
1. Family and age criteria
Indicators should be linked to events within the immediate family in children aged 0-10 years or mothers aged (12-50 years). This minimises misclassification of recordings related to events outside the immediate family (e.g. problems in teenage peer relationships etc).

2. Biopsychosocial harm
Includes harm caused by single significant events or harm caused by multiple less severe events. Highly relevant indicators are associated with considerable harm across different child development areas, including but not limited to:
•	Biological: prolonged stress responses (HPA axis, SHRP), negatively impacting physiological development and increasing risk for longer-term health problems.
•	Psychological: disruptions to child attachment and risk for developing a disorganised attachment, creating negative core beliefs or schemas of threat and a heightened sense of vulnerability.
•	Social/behavioural: Learned coping responses that become maladaptive (self-perpetuating, hindering further learning) such as social avoidance, emotion dysregulation, mistrust, overdependency, etc.

3. Clinical relevance
Indicators should be clinically relevant and represent family needs that are amenable to early healthcare intervention, such as the national healthy child programme. This excludes broader social adversity indicators such as deprivation, where national measures already exists (e.g. IMD).

Rating index
Overall rating & meaning
•	8-10: The indicator is clearly an appropriate and consistently relevant measure for identifying ACEs
•	6-7: The indicator is an appropriate measure but with some minor inconsistences for identifying relevant ACEs
•	4-5: The indicator is an uncertain or equivocal measure for identifying ACEs
•	1-3: The indicator is not appropriate and is of low relevance for identifying ACEs

## Individual rating descriptions and examples
### 9-10: Definitively relevant
Represent events with explicit immediate actions to secure the child’s or mother’s safety. See Child maltreatment. Psychological abuse. Physical abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. Intimate partner violence, child protection procedures, case conferences, out-of-home placements.
Example intervention needs: out-of-home child placements, maternal emergency housing, police.
Recorded examples in data: Social services case conference, Child protection category neglect, Child on protection register, Victim of domestic violence, Female genital mutilation, Neonatal withdrawal symptoms from maternal use of drugs or addiction

### 8: Highly relevant
Events represent families with cause to suspect that a child is or have experienced significant adversity, with longer-term harm if no comprehensive intervention is provided. 
Example intervention needs: Entry point Level 3 "Universal Partnership Plus" in healthy child programme,6,7 CPA, maternal psychiatric admission, mental health and social care with longer-term MDT input etc.
Recorded examples in data: Drug addiction maintenance therapy - methadone, Alcohol misuse - enhanced service completed, Admission to substance misuse detoxification centre, History of domestic violence, History of sexual abuse, Personal history of other physical trauma

### 6-7: Probably relevant
Events often represent an at-risk family with a reasonable chance of ongoing or future significant child harm. 
Example intervention needs: Parenting programmes and individual maternal and/or child treatment
Recorded examples in data: [X]Assault, [X]Obsessive - compulsive disorder, Unspecified nonorganic psychosis, Poisoning: 4-Aminophenol derivatives, Housing unsatisfactory, Other stressful life events affecting family and child, Observation for other suspected diseases and conditions, Suicide risk, Borderline personality disorder, Personal history of other mental and behavioural disorders

### 5: Moderately relevant
Events represent family stress and minor adversity with a higher likelihood of escalating into further problems if no support is provided.
Example intervention needs: Entry point Level 2 "Universal Partnership" in the healthy child programme,6,7 record in notes/discuss MDT, health visitor home visits for monitoring and psychoeducation, adult or child referral to primary care mental health team.
Recorded examples in data: Supervision of very young primigravida, [V]Other unwanted pregnancy, A/N care: social risk, Family support, Domestic stress, Examination and observation following other accident, Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety], Generalised anxiety disorder, Problem situation

### 3-4: Minor relevance
Events represents lower level family concerns likely to be monitored by a GP or nurse only. No further action required.
Recorded examples in data: Head injury, Scalds, Chlordiazepoxide 5mg capsules, Head injury, Fracture of tibia, Poisoning: 4-Aminophenol derivatives, Burn of second degree of shoulder and upper limb, except wrist and hand, Crush injury, finger(s), Fracture of clavicle

### 1-2: Not at all
Events are common in the general child population and in families seen in primary care. On their own, these presentations represent very low risk or no concerns for child harm. Can be seen in most well-functioning families. No monitoring required.
Recorded examples in data: Maternal diabetes, urogenital blood and endocrine diseases, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, 111 contact disposition, Dental diseases and conditions NOS, Anal fissure unspecified, Contraception usage


## Indicators to rate
Please rate each below indicator for its relevance and appropriateness of identifying ACEs on a scale between 0 (not all) and 10 (definitively relevant) using the above guidance notes and your professional knowledge. Try to not think too long about your decisions. The survey should take 20-60 minutes to complete.

Specific criteria linked to indicators are shown in brackets.
Information inside the brackets below indicators denote the most frequently recorded coding terms we found in the data. 
Beyond the guidance above and the coding terms, there is no information presented to help you assess relevance; this will require you to reflect on your prior experiences and knowledge. 

All indicators contain a minimum of 100 recordings per 100,000 mother-child pairs.
