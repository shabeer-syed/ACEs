# Panel ratings: Indicators of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) for routine primary and secondary electronic health records
### [Go back](https://shabeer-syed.github.io/ACEs/)

### Introduction
An estimated 1 in 4 families present to health care with recorded adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and substantially higher risks of poorer health outcomes, repeated hospital admissions and care costs.

Everyone recognises the very significant challenges of identifying and monitoring of ACEs across individual services and nationally. We know GPs, clinical teams as well as researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

We have therefore invited you to complete a survey to help us decide on relevant ACE indicators for identifying at-risk families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 10-years post-birth.

### Why are adverse childhood experiences important to measure using routine data?
Numerous clinical and UK public health policies (1,2,3,4,5) prioritise early identification of ACEs to effectively offer high-risk families support in national and local improvement program (e.g. family nurse partnership). Indicators in electronic health records (EHRs) allow for automated early clinical warning systems and longitudinal population-based classification of high-risk populations for targeted interventions at a relatively low cost. The ability to link mother's and children's records provides an opportunity to measure ACEs intergenerationally and during vital periods of prevention with regular follow-ups across care systems.

### The survey
Having read the guidance notes, this survey will take 20-60 mins to complete. The survey will ask you to rate different routinely recorded indicators of potential ACEs to help us in the selection process of deriving a final set of relevant indicators. Your "ratings" will only be available to the main researcher and their supervisors (see below). If you agree to participate, we may invite you via email to a second round of ratings. Where relevant, the second round will help resolve disagreements from the first round by providing you additional information (i.e. overall ratings from 1st round) to guide your decisions. Your input will be acknowledged in any publication.

### Survey
An indicator combines codes or measures of similar health care presentations.

Below is a list of manually selected indicators containing potential recordings of ACEs from GP practices and hospital admissions of child (aged 0-10 years) or maternal (12-50 years) presentations. This set of indicators are classed as “tentative” as they showed inconsistent risk associations with a pre-defined ACE reference marker (e.g. child maltreatment, intimate partner violence) across different machine and manual statistical prediction models (n=472,000 patients).

### Instructions

We would like you to rate each indicator on a scale, 0-10, for its relevance and appropriateness to indicate an ACE.
Please use the below criteria and rating guidance (see next page) along with your professional judgement to rate indicator’s on their individual basis regardless of context (e.g. dynamic and protective factors), considering the average families you’ve seen clinically ignoring any cost/time implications.
