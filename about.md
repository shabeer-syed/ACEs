# Introduction
<img style="float: right;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabeer-syed/ACEs/main/smaller%20overview%20aces.png">
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic, neglectful or [violent](https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/) experiences in childhood. Examples of ACEs range from child maltreatment and witnessing violence in the home to growing up with a parent with a mental health problem [(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/fastfact.html). Studies estimate that approximately 1 in 2 adults in England reports experiencing at least one ACE in childhood [(2)](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72). ACEs are linked to considerable health burden in adulthood, and can pose a substantial pressure on families, health and social care systems [(3)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(17)30118-4/fulltext).

ACEs are preventable. However, many ACEs are very difficult to identify in childhood. Most studies rely on self-reports of adults many years after the event happened when it's more challenging to prevent the harmful effects of ACEs.

## How can routinely collected non-identifiable patient data help?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone recognises the significant challenges of identifying and monitoring ACEs across individual services and nationally.
We know NHS trusts, GPs, clinical teams and researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are routinely collected data from hospitals, GPs and other health systems. Data is often recorded as events happen and as part of routine care. The information is available shortly after a health care presentation and pose less burden to patients. All data is made non-identifiable and stored securely (watch the video below to find out more). 

In the UK, mothers' and children's data can be linked across services. The ability to link mothers' and children's records allows for measuring ACEs before pregnancy, throughout childhood and intergenerationally.

We have developed *indicators* for identifying *domains* of ACEs and at-risk families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth. This page provides more information on definitions and brief methods used to develop the indicators. [Find the pre-print paper here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3937569)

## Aims: Domains and indicators of ACEs?
--------------------------------------------

Each ACE indicator represents a variable of grouped codes or measures for a potential recorded ACE in mothers or children. Indicators are further grouped into six or seven overall ACE domains.

## How can ACEs indicators and domains help (so what)?
The main objective of the ACE domains and indicators is to help improve the health of vulnerable families and individuals by promoting a trauma-informed approach to care. The ACE indicators aim to inform public health policy and service commissioning by data-driven integration of trauma-informed care across health platforms.

We **do not** recommend using ACE indicators for screening purposes to guide clinical decision making on an individual  level. Further research must be conducted to evaluate if the benefits of individual identification or screening outweigh the harms, so screening does not become an end in and of itself.

## ACEs and the four R's
Potential implications of the ACEs research can be conceptualised via the four "R's". The four R's represent key assumptions of trauma-informed approaches summarised by SAMHSA’s.

* **Realisation** about trauma and understanding how trauma can affect families, groups, organizations, and communities as well as individuals.

* **Recognise** the signs of trauma by people in the organization or system

* **Respond** by applying trauma-informed approaches to all areas of care, including:
    * Changing the language of how we approach populations exposed to trauma, from greetings at the door to the language of executives and the governance board;

    * Staff training and a budget that supports this ongoing training

    * Leadership that realises the role of trauma in the people they serve and their staff

    * The organization has practitioners trained in evidence-based trauma practices. The organisation's policies, such as mission statements, staff handbooks and manuals, promote a culture based on beliefs about resilience, recovery, and healing from trauma. 

* **Resist re-traumatization**, avoid triggering painful memories, and re-traumatize clients with trauma histories. For example, they recognise that using restraints on a person who has been sexually abused or placing a child who has been neglected and abandoned in a seclusion room may be re-traumatizing and interfere with healing and recovery.
