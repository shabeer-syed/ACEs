## Introduction
<img style="float: right;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabeer-syed/ACEs/main/overview%20aces%20home.png">
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic or [violent](https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/) events that happen in childhood. Examples range from child maltreatment, and witnessing violence in the home, to growing up with a parent with a mental health problem [(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/fastfact.html). Studies estimate that approximatley 1 in 2 adults in England reports experiencing at least one ACE in childhood [(2)](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72). ACEs are linked to considerable health burden in adulthood, and can pose a substantial pressure on families, health and social care systems [(3)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(17)30118-4/fulltext).

ACEs are preventable. However, many ACEs are very difficult to identify in childhood. Most studies rely on self-reports of adults many years after the event happened, when its more difficult to prevent the negative effects of ACEs.

## How can routinely collected patient data help?
Everyone recognises the  significant challenges of identifying and monitoring ACEs across individual services and nationally.
We know NHS trusts, GPs, clinical teams as well as researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are routinely collected data from hospitals, GPs and other health systems. Data is often recorded as events happens and part of routine care, which means we can indentify needs shortly after a health care presentation. Data is available at relatively low cost to patients and researchers. 

In the UK, mothers and children's data can be linked across services. The ability to link mother’s and children’s records provides an opportunity to measure ACEs before pregnancy, throughout childhood and even intergenerationally.

## What are ACE indicators?
We have developed indicators for identifying ACEs and at-risk families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth. This page provides more information on definitions and brief methods used to develop the indicators. 

Each ACE indicator represents a variable of grouped codes or measures for a potential recorded ACE in mothers or children. Indicators are further grouped into six or seven overall ACE domains.

## Definitions and inclusions

We defined ACE indicators as any experience within the family environment recorded in the child or the maternal record considered to be:

> * Frightening, violent, traumatic or neglectful [(see WHO violence definition)](https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf),  with potential for immediate or longer-term harm to a child's biopsychosocial development (intentionally or unintentionally) [(see UK government definition)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/942454/Working_together_to_safeguard_children_inter_agency_guidance.pdf), as caused by;

> * A single significant event or through repeated exposure;

> * Caused by external factors and not the child themselves such as self-harm, and;

> * Amenable to health or social care intervention at a family level (i.e. excluding wider factors such as socioeconomic status, community violence, school bullying etc).


We made several adaptations to previously studied ACEs to allow for feasible ascertainment in electronic health records (EHRs). We defined indicators as variables of grouped codes and measures. We aimed to develop ACE indicators that reflected clinically meaningful risk groups of adversity to identify families that may be eligible for targeted maternal-child care interventions in England (e.g. targeted care pathway of the Healthy Child Programme by Public Health England). See also WHO for [intervention studies](https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/violence-prevention/global-status-report-on-violence-against-children-2020).

We manually grouped indicators into broader ACE domains consistent with the [original study](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(98)00017-8/fulltext) by [Kaiser Permanente and CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/index.html).  Due to the lack of recordings, we collapsed all types of child abuse and neglect into child maltreatment (CM). We collapsed "imprisonment of household members" and "household challenges" into Adverse family environments. We created a separate indicator, "Social service involvement" (SSI), for social care related codes that did not contain descriptions of CM or mIPV. SSI was merged with CM in the final selection process owing to few recordings and high intercorrelations.

Given the substantial under-recording of CM and mIPV (e.g. see [1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/barriers-and-facilitators-of-disclosures-of-domestic-violence-by-mental-health-service-users-qualitative-study/7A690CCBC0322D045442549A5FA3C4CF), [2](https://bjgp.org/content/67/659/e437.long)) we also added the domain “high-risk presentations of CM” (HRP-CM). HRP-CM encompassed indicators from the [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg89/chapter/1-Guidance) and [Royal College of General Practitioners (RGCP)](https://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/resources/toolkits/child-safeguarding-toolkit.aspx) that should raise clinical suspicion for CM.

ACEs can be recorded in both mothers' and children's records and based on each specific child's time from birth. Children are therefore considered unexposed if no relevant maternal or child recording occur in the relevant period, regardless of previous exposure in children within the same family to mirror changes in stress levels as the family moves through different life stages.
