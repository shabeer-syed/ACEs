# Introduction
<img style="float: right;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shabeer-syed/ACEs/main/smaller%20overview%20aces.png">
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic, neglectful or [violent](https://www.who.int/violenceprevention/approach/definition/en/) experiences in childhood. Examples of ACEs range from child maltreatment and witnessing violence in the home to growing up with a parent with a mental health problem [(1)](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/fastfact.html). Studies estimate that approximately 1 in 2 adults in England reports experiencing at least one ACE in childhood [(2)](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72). ACEs are linked to considerable health burden in adulthood, and can pose a substantial pressure on families, health and social care systems [(3)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(17)30118-4/fulltext).

ACEs are preventable. However, many ACEs are very difficult to identify in childhood. Most studies rely on self-reports of adults many years after the event happened when it's more challenging to prevent the harmful effects of ACEs.

## How can routinely collected non-identifiable patient data help?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone recognises the significant challenges of identifying and monitoring ACEs across individual services and nationally.
We know NHS trusts, GPs, clinical teams and researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are routinely collected data from hospitals, GPs and other health systems. Data is often recorded as events happen and as part of routine care. The information is available shortly after a health care presentation and pose less burden to patients. All data is made non-identifiable and stored securely (watch the video below to find out more). 

In the UK, mothers' and children's data can be linked across services. The ability to link mothers' and children's records allows for measuring ACEs before pregnancy, throughout childhood and intergenerationally.

## Domains and indicators of ACEs?
--------------------------------------------
We have developed *indicators* for identifying *domains* of ACEs among families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth [Find the pre-print paper here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3937569)

Each ACE indicator represents a variable of grouped codes or measures for a potential recorded ACE in mothers or children. Indicators are further grouped into six or seven overall ACE domains.

## Aims
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of the ACE domains and indicators is to help improve the health of vulnerable families by enhancing the methodological standard and utility of measuring ACEs in linked EHRs of mothers and children. ACE indicators have the potential to support [trauma-informed](https://store.samhsa.gov/product/SAMHSA-s-Concept-of-Trauma-and-Guidance-for-a-Trauma-Informed-Approach/SMA14-4884) data-driven approaches in research, public health, policy and larger care organisations.

We follow WHO's [the Minsk Declaration](https://www.euro.who.int/en/publications/policy-documents/the-minsk-declaration) and view all ACEs through a *"life-course"* and a *"trauma-informed"* lens. This approach acknowledges that risk is not static and depends on the interaction of multiple unmeasured promotive, protective, and risk factors throughout generations and people's lives.


# What ACE indicators are not: 
It is essential to note that ACE indicators: 
* Only identify experiences recorded in semi-structured and coded non-identfiable data, and and many children might have concerns recorded only in free-text data that
is not captured in coded data.
*Do not represent an exhaustive list of all possible adversities experienced by children
* Cannot make inferences about an individual. This means that indicators cannot be used to guide individual-level clinical decision-making including screening, diagnosing or labelling children or families to be at-risk of harm. Most children with ACEs **do not** develop poorer health outcomes and show incredible resilience to adversity.
* Do not make causal claims about posible mechanisims underpinning different ACEs
* Do not account for different protective factors and contexts

The limitations of ACEs has been summarised [elsewhere]( https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-policy-and-society/article/introduction-adverse-childhood-experiences-aces-implications-and-challenges/A1E57E800C74406E84F93AB9F8CB125D).
