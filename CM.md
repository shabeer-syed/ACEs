## Definition

Any recorded act of commission or omission by a parent or caregiver resulting in harm, the potential for harm or threat of child harm, including neglect, psychological, physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Harm does not need to be intended.[45](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61706-7/fulltext) In the UK, [statutory guidelines of CM](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/942454/Working_together_to_safeguard_children_inter_agency_guidance.pdf) include child exposure to IPV, and maternal evidence for omission or commission during pregnancy such as NAS and FAS.

Includes indicators such as neglect (pre-post birth), child protection recordings or out-of-home placements by social care services (see [code list browser](https://acesinehrs.com/codelist)).

Suspected CM included any maltreatment-related indicator with cosssdes or measures describing presentations likely to refer to CM but without mentioning the underlying cause (e.g. harm caused by non-specified person), safeguarding procedures or child social service interventions.48 For instance, the “suspected CM, NOS” indicator contains codes mentioning “Victim of sexual abuse”, “Multi-professional risk assessment done”, “Assault in the home”
