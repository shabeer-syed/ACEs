## Definitions of the final ACE domains 
---------------------------------

### Reference standard used for validation

**Outcome/reference standard: Definitive child maltreatment (CM) and maternal intimate partner violence (mIPV) 2-years pre-birth up to 5-years post birth**

A composite variable of the definite CM and mIPV domains, containing indicators such as neglect (pre-post birth), child protection recordings or out-of-home placements by social care services (see [code list browser](https://acesinehrs.com/codelist)). CM and mIPV often co-occur as forms of family violence. We selected this reference standard to encapsulate consistent core ACEs (CM/mIPV), clinically meaningful outcomes, and to represent a cumulation of underlying adversity.[4](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-26231-001),[9](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.2704995) We also aimed to use a reference standard that separates adverse experiences from the adverse stress response of the child.54  Indicators included in the reference standard were excluded from the development/validation. We lists all included and excluded indicators by domains [here](https://acesinehrs.com/Indicators). 

**Definitive or probable CM (reference standard; birth up to 5-years post-birth)**

Any recorded act of commission or omission by a parent or caregiver resulting in harm, the potential for harm or threat of child harm, including neglect, psychological, physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Harm does not need to be intended.[45](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(08)61706-7/fulltext) In the UK, [statutory guidelines of CM](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/942454/Working_together_to_safeguard_children_inter_agency_guidance.pdf) include child exposure to IPV, and maternal evidence for omission or commission during pregnancy such as NAS and FAS.
