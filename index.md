## Welcome
--------------------------------------------

We have developed indicators for identifying ACEs in routinely collected non-identifiable health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth. This website provides more information on definitions, codes and measures used to develop indicators for ACEs. Please use the menu above to find out more. [Find the pre-print paper here.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3937569) See also the published [systematic review](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/106/1/44.full.pdf)
