## Welcome
We have developed indicators for identifying ACEs in routinely collected non-identifiable health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth. This website provides more information on definitions, codes and measures used to develop indicators for ACEs. Please use the menu above to find out more. See also the published [systematic review](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/106/1/44.full.pdf)
