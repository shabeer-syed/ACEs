## Welcome
--------------------------------------------

We have developed and validated indicators for identifying ACEs in routinely collected non-identifiable health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 5-years post-birth. This website provides more information on definitions, codes and measures used to develop indicators for ACEs. Please use the menu above to find out more. [See publication here.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00061-9/fulltext) See also the published [systematic review](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/106/1/44.full.pdf)

This library stores ACE indicators and algorithms accompanying the paper published in Lancet Digital Health [*"Identifying adverse childhood experiences with electronic health records of linked mothers and children in England: a multistage development and validation study, (2022). Shabeer Syed, Arturo Gonzalez-Izquierd, Janice Allister, Gene Feder, Leah Li, Ruth Gilbert."*](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(22)00061-9/fulltext).

Users should cite the www.ACEsinEHRs.com library and the above accompanying Lancet Digital Health publication in all research outputs, presentations and reports.
