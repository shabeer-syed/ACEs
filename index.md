## Introduction
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are potentially traumatic of violent events that happen in childhood. Examples range from child maltreatment, and witnessing violence in the home, to growing up with a parent with a mental health problem.([1])(https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/fastfact.html) Studies estimate that approximatley 1 in 2 adults reports experiencing at least one ACE in childhood.([2])(https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72) ACEs are linked to considerable health burden in adulthood, and can pose a substantial pressure on families,health and social care systems.

ACEs are preventable. However, many ACEs are very difficult to identify in childhood. Most studies rely on self-reports of adults many years after the event happened, when its difficult to prevent their health effects.

Everyone recognises the  significant challenges of identifying and monitoring ACEs across individual services and nationally.
We know NHS trusts, GPs, clinical teams as well as researchers are at the forefront of this challenge.

We have developed indicators for identifying ACEs and at-risk families using routinely collected health care data of mothers and children presenting to GPs and hospitals, from pregnancy up to 10-years post-birth. This repository lists all codes and measures retained from the final validation process and accompanied [systematic reviews](https://adc.bmj.com/content/archdischild/106/1/44.full.pdf).

<span style="color:red">This site is under development and accompanies the manuscript *"Development and validation of indicators for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in English primary and secondary care records: a population-based birth cohort study"* submitted for journal peer-review. The content should not be used until the final article has been published. The information is not intended for clinical use.</span>
