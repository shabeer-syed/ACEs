## Definition
The term "adverse family environments" refers to any clinically intervenable psychosocial risk factor or experience recorded in the child or the parent that met the [pre-defined inclusion criteria](https://acesinehrs.com/definitions). The AFE domain broadly aligns with the original ACE domain titled *"household challenges"* from the CDC-Kaiser ACE Study, supplemented with clinically relevant definitions to select indicators consistent with the [UK guidance for identifying families in need](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supporting-families-programme-guidance-2022-to-2025/chapter-4-identifying-and-working-with-families#identifying-and-evidencing-family-need), and the [US Preventive Services Task Force for social risk domains](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2783975). The AFE domain includes indicators from multiple [social risk domains](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/938785/jus210019f3_1633975995.29794.png?Expires=1660916428&Signature=VNgy5R3mKpHhh4XvhQJ-StCiSk5UlP3JpFe2Z2ntdQMljvE2pm4q-S2rYjGwpfGfIv49UjTUt7Dy~05Hm23kIqj7DD8qJMkTQhZYTG06H09Y3u65ZoSlwPWU1FwnMuW0e4zJ4WtPSxbpfty3nRAyp4oB8RwIfH-UqhOrx3KRlz3DNnYb64Gnlq1D3m8Qp-RGHUBunYb9DBe4BaLlCHc6~~5muOqKB97VikpeeW0PBJMvGL0xcY-v7xT1UPnkdZ~EUrL5r0uory5uEJiRsbKoN0BCG1MlfylOldSdwqYx-yALfrDRu26sCxQERf1-8VHuQfLGMPLSFHlt3WORIWVTwA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) covering clinical concerns relating to housing instability (e.g., homelessness), “criminal behaviours in the household”, food insecurity, education and financial strains, transportation difficulties, utility needs, aspects of interpersonal safety that are not already addressed by other ACE domains. This domain also incorporates [Royal College of General Practitioners](https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/62/600/e478.full.pdf) recommended indicators for recordings that should raise a cause for concern.
